# 🧑‍💻 SOC Analyst Lab Series – TryHackMe

Hands-on SOC (Security Operations Center) simulations focusing on **log analysis**, **alert triage**, **threat investigation**, and **incident reporting**.  
This project documents my learning journey and practical experience with **real-world SOC workflows** through **TryHackMe** labs.

## 🧠 Overview

This repository contains detailed notes, workflows, and findings from various **SOC analyst labs** completed on **TryHackMe**.  
Each lab simulates a real-world enterprise environment, offering exposure to common tools, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used in security operations.
